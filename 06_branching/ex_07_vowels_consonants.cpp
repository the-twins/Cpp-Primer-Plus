// Write a program that reads input a word at a time until a lone q is entered. The
// program should then report the number of words that began with vowels, the number that began
// with consonants, and the number that fit neither of those categories.
// One approach is to use isalpha() to discriminate between words beginning with
// letters and those that donâ€™t and then use an if or switch statement to further identify those
// passing the isalpha() test that begin with vowels. A sample run might look like this:
// Enter words (q to quit):
// The 12 awesome oxen ambled
// quietly across 15 meters of lawn. q
// 5 words beginning with vowels
// 4 words beginning with consonants
// 2 others
#include <iostream>
#include <cctype>
